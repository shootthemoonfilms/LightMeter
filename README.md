# Photography Assistant

Photography Assistant provides exposure setting calculation and depth of
field/hyperfocal distance calculation.  It was designed mostly to use with
film cameras, although the dof/hyperfocal function can be useful for digital
cameras too.

It also tries to take advantage of the ambient light sensor on the phone.
The exposure setting calculation supports three modes: aperture priority,
shutter priority and manual mode.
